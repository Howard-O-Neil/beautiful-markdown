# Beautiful Markdown

Markdown language is very easy to use for building websites using static site builders, but it's also very limited, with very little to choose from and no fancy html styling, right? Wrong!
Or at least not as much as you probably think. This classless CSS library is the result of a quick experiment to create awesome web pages using only markdown language.

Some choices were made that were probably not intended by the creators of the language (like a different use of blockquotes as well as bold and italics styles). There are certainly plenty of alternative options  and potetial improvements out there, so send me your feedback!

Check out the [demo](https://bndp.github.io/beautiful-markup).
