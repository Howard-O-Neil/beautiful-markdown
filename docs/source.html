### Dogs

The domestic dog (Canis familiaris when considered a separate species or Canis lupus familiaris when considered a subspecies of the wolf) is a wolf-like canid that can be found distributed around the world. The dog descended from an ancient, now-extinct wolf with the modern wolf being the dog's nearest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by hunter–gatherers more than 15,000 years ago, which predates agriculture. Their long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they can thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.

The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities and physical attributes. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship and, more recently, aiding disabled people and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of &quot;man's best friend.&quot;
